# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should represent the accessibility/visual helper theme.

For a quick start, you can:
1. Use an online icon generator
2. Create simple colored squares with the text "O" or an eye symbol
3. Use any free icon from icon libraries (make sure they're properly licensed)

The extension will work without custom icons, but Chrome may show a default placeholder icon.
